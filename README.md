This repo forms part of a project where I built the same app using Svelte, Nuxt, Next, Solid and Angular — all but one of which I'd never use before — in an effort to show that picking-up frameworks isn't quite the huge deal hiring managers seem to think it is...

The app itself is nothing overly fancy — just a basic film discovery site covering all the essentials one would expect such as search (actor/director/title), categories, filmographies, cast & crew. I took a classic ‘less is more’ approach with regards to the UI. It’s certainly not the most impressive thing you’ll ever see — but it is a perfectly functional single-page app fetching data from a live API, which is very much the bread and butter of modern front-end development.

All five repos can be found here on GitHub:

### Project Summary

It took just over a day to get the app up and running. I love the docs, featuring great tutorials, examples and a particularly nice setup script — that said, I found a few key concepts were buried amongst other seemingly irrelevant information, though I did eventually find answers without having to trawl the web. The concept of ‘runes’ (a strange term, but there we are!) is great — it’s a significant step forward from the likes of React’s useState, what with runes being baked-in as part of the ‘language’ so to speak. Overall, it’s a sort-of hybrid of Next and Vue, featuring unified components, server-side rendering and file-based routing amongst other notable features — I really, really like it!
